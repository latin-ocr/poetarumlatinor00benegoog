The moral seems plain. The imitation of Ovid produced
brilliant poets, the imitation of Vergil produced dismal versifiers.
And where the Romans failed, it is not very probable that we
shall succeed. The verse·writer of today‚ then, cannot do better
than model his style on ovid, and when he can equal Ovid in
the manipulation of the hexameter he may begin to regret that
he cannot eqnal Vergil.

And while on this subject it may not be omiss to call atten-
tion to two writers of very high merit, who generally receive

’ far less attention than they deserve. The first is Petronius

Arbiter, who always in his verses, though osten merely moch-
heroic, shows the brilliancy and refinement (artistic, if not moral)
so characteristic of his strange genins; the second is the Egyptian
Claudian, who at times in his Panegyrics rises to a sar higher
level than those who have not studied his works would ever
suspect.

In recommending Ovid as the best model for Elegiacs, I shall
probably meet with few dissentients, as the rhythmical eccentri·
cities of Propertius do not constitute his chief beauty, while the
remains of the other Elegists of the Augustan Age are in every
case too scanty to form the basis of a “style‘’ But a word of
explanation may perhaps be necessary sor the fact that I have
included passages from two Elegiae writers of the sixteenth
century, while no such “modern ” hexameters have been admitted.
The reason sor this is that the comparatively very small quantity

· of classical Elegiae verse in existence rendered it necessary to go

somewhat further afield3 and as to the two writers in question,
it would be a bold man who would deny the claims os Muretus
as a Latin stylist, while in Joannes Secundus we have a poet

. who, had he chosen to make use oi the vernacular, would

without doubt have taken a high place among the erotic poets
oi the world.

As sor the construction of this worlr itself, simple references
are given to those writers whose pocms are included in the
Corpus Poetarum Latinomm, a book which is everywhere
readily accessible and which every serious student os Latin must
oi course possess. In preparing the quotations from Manilius,
1 need hardly say that the Noctes Manilianae of Prof. R Ellis
