’ a nature, or imitation may degenerate into parody. The “style”
of Lucan or of Propertius is rarely effective except as used by
those poets themselves. ’

Το pass from generalities to particulars.

To the would-be writer of hexameters one name will at once
suggest itsels. Everyone possesses a Vergil3 many people have ⁶
read some of him; what more natural, then, than to try and
imitate the writer who is admittedly the greatest master of the
Latin Epic metre? And yet perhaps this very greatness‚ this
very superiority over all his rivals‚ renders him of little value
for purposes of imitation. The charm of Vergil's style is incom-
municable; it is like the charrn of old coloured glass, no imitation
can at all reproduce it. And again, one of his greatest beauties
consists in the frequent, at times ahnost startling changes in his
rhythm‚—changes necessary in the handhng of a long epic and
brilliant in the hands of a poet, but hardly called for in the
short pieces modern writers usually produce, and dangerously
liable with any but a master to result in intolerable harshness.
Yes, Vergil is inimitable; how inimitable can only be fully
appreciated by those who have studied the productions of his
imitators. Scaliger says somewhere, when suggesting for a
criminal the worst penalty he can imagine,

“Hunc neque fabrili lassent ergastula massa,
nec rigidas.vexent fossa metalla manus;
lexica contexat.”

1 should suggest, Make him read Silius Italicus.

A safer, an easier‚ an altogether better model is Ovid. The
charm of his style, the nearest approach to Greek that Latin
ever knew, no one will deny; and it was a charm that did not
wholly die in the deserts of Scythia. Such works as the Ciris,
so Ovidian in feeling if not in language‚ or the brilliant thoroughly
Ovidian Astronomica of Manilius are evidence enough of this.
The school of Ovidian poets was shortlived. Brought to perfec·
tion already in the reign of Nero, it had soon to give way to
the leaden Latin age of Statius; o nunquam data fata longa
summis! But the poetry which had inspired Lucan might feel
perhaps that its work was done.
