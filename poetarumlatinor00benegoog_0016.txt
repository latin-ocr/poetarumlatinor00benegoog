¹These last four are the most important of the many short works attributed
to Vergi13 they are probably none of them his, though doubtless of suffi-
ciently early date. The Culex is far inferior to the other three.

¹ These are entirely lost. The Elegy that bears the name of Gallus is late, and
attributed by some to Maximian.

⁸ Only the first two oi these aro by Tibullus himself. The third is by “ Lygdamus '';
tbe sourth is a collection os poems by Sulpicia and others.

‘He ceased to write about this timo, but there seems reason to believe that
he did not die till much later.

⁸ Probably the work of an Italian of the 15th century.

‘Probably not by Ovid, though doubtless written in classical times.
