‘Amost splendid and fascinating boolr on a subject oi nndying interest. The great

‘To say that a book ls by the author of “Mehalah¹' is to imply that it oontsdns a
story cast on strong lines, containing dramatic possibilities, wivid and sympathetic
descriptions οἰ Nature. and a wealth os ingenious imagery.·-Speaker. .

'That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a conclusion that
may be very generally accepted. His wiews of life are fresh and vigorous, his
language pointed and characteristic, the incidents oi which he makes use are
striking and original, his characters are life-like, and though somewhat excep-
tional people‚ are drawn and coloured with artistIc force. Addto this that his
descriptions os soenes and scenery are painted with the loving eyes and skilled

· hands ol a musterus his art, that he is always fresh and never dull, and under
such conditions it is no wonder that readers have gained conlidence both in his
power of amusing and satissying thena, and that year hy year his popularity
widens.'-Court Οἰνοπίαν.
