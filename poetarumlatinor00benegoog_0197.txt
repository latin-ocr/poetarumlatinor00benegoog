she has been rccused oi blasphemyand bad teste: ‘t gory nightrnore'3 'rhideous

’ travesty'; 'grotesque vulgarisation'; ‘unworthy of criticisrn't ‘vulgar redun-
dancy¹; ‘sickening details '—these are rome oi the secular dowerr os speech.
On the other hand, the 'Guardian' praises ‘the dignity os ite conceptione, the
reserve round the centra} Fignre, the fine imagery os the scene rud circumstance,

ro much that is elevating and devout'; the ⁸ illustrated Church News' etyles the .

appealing to what is best in it ' 3 the ‘Christian World' says it is written ‘by one
who has more than conventional reverence, who has tried to tell the story that it
