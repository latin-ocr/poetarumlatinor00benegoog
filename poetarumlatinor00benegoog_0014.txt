were continually before me, though as the passages which Ι have
cited are naturally taken from those parts of the author which
are easiest and least obscure, the revolution which that work has
made in the text is not so apparent here as would otherwise
have been the case; for Petronius I have used the edition of
Buecheler, for the Aetna that os Munro, as the best hitherto
obtainable; sor the other writers quoted I have generally based
my text on Wemsdori's Poetae Latini Minores, supplemented,
where possible, from other sources. My own emendations, as
is natural in a work of this kind, are few and unimportant; they
are printed, where they occur, in italics.

Ibave only one thing to add. Thosc who use this book will
no doubt make more use os the passages which are quoted in
full than os the references ; it is a trouble looking up a reference,
everyone knows. Bearing this in mind, I have purposely abstained
from quoting many passages in themselves interesting, which
were, however, owing to peculiariu‘es of prosody and idiom, regular
enough under the later Empire, but unadmitted in earlier times,
likely to lead careless people astray. But I have not chosen sor
the sake os the indolent entirely to eliminate such passages, so
that I may as well state plainly here that the fact of apassage
being cited in these pages does not necessarily mean that a
similar passage would pass muster in a schoolboy’s exercise, nor
that it is elegant or even grammatically correct according to the
best canons of style. The author no doubt thought s0; how
sar Asconius would have been likely to agree with him can best
be gathered from a study of the chronological table, which has
been added sor this purpose.
