PREFACE

These who use this book can do so in more ways than one,
but its chief object is to serve as an aid to Latin Verse Compo-
sition3 sor this reason I have refrained srom giving references ’
to archaic writers such as Ennius or Lucretius and to Sat-irists
such as Horace or Persius, whose style of versification it is not
usual to imitate,

1t cannot be denied that there is a very general tendency at
the present time to disparage the artos writing 'Latin verses; I
do not propose to argue against this tendency here, except so
sar as to remark that a decay in the art of writing Latin verses
cannot fail to bring about a simultaneous decay in the power Ι
of appreciating Latin poetry. A man who has never driven
cannot appreciata a good whip; nor can a man who has never
climbed anything higher than Primrose Hill appreciate the ice-
cralt of a Melchior; nor can a man who has never written Latin
hexameters appreciate the beauty of Vergil. One need only
think of some of the emendations proposed by German scholars
to feel the trnth oi this.

Everyone will admit that one of the chief essentials for Latin
composition is to leam to look at the subject on which it is
proposed to write from a Latin point of view. To assist in this
object is the principal aim oi this book. Say one wants to
write Latin verses on the subject oi “Spring”, for instance.
Let him read over carefully, not once only, the passages mentioned
here under that heading, and any others that may suggest
