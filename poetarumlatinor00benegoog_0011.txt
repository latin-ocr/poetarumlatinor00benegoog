themselves to him, and thus try to come to think oi Spring as
a Roman would have thought of it. How does one. think of
Spring? ·“The winter is past, the flowers appear on the earth, '’
buthe must remember thatin Italy this will not be April, but
some time nearer January. “The attendant birds crowd round
and fill the air with jocund loyalty‚'' but let him remember
that the “dear good angel of the spring, the nightingale,” is
the female bird andis mourning sor her murdered son. “The
Earth, which was not dead but slept, unclosed her eyes‚’' but
let him remember that there is “Spring for the herb and tree,
no Spring for uS,”-or rather, let him sorget that he has
learnt better. The first necessity is to sorget. He must throw
his imagination back into the first century Au). and must sorget
everything that has happened since. He must sorget that the
earth moves, he must surget that there are· more than four
elements, he must think of Switzerland as inhabited by devils
and of Britain as an inhospitable desert, or he will never write
Latin that a Roman ol the time os Augustus would have under·
stood.

So much for the state of mind; next, as to materials.

A poet may have a style of his own; but more people write
Latin verses than are poets‚ and for this majority it is os the*
first importance to have and keep continually before them some
one definite model to imitate. There are few people who, if
called upon to compose an English Prize Poem, would write one
verse in the style of spenser, and the next in the style of
Rudyard Kipling, and yet there are probably sewer who would
think it strange to begin a Latin line with a tag from Lucretius
and end it with a tag from Claudian. But then Latin is a
dead language, so that one cannot murder it, perhaps.

’ The choice of such a model must depend of course in'some
measure on the nature of the subject upon which it is proposed
to write, but it is perhaps well not to be too greatly influenced
by such consideratione. Lucilius Iunior (to give him aname) is
not necessarily a better model than Vergil for a description of
Etna because his account of that volcano is more than fifty times
longer. Nor is it perhaps quite superfluous to point out that
the model chosen should not be os too pronounced and individual
